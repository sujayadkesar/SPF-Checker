# 🔍 SPF-Checker

A bash-based tool for checking the SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records of a domain 💻
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## What is SPF? 🤔

SPF is a mechanism used by domain owners to specify which mail servers are authorized to send email on behalf of their domain 📧. This helps reduce the likelihood of their domains being used for spam and phishing attempts 🚫.

## How does the SPF Checker Tool work? 🧐

The SPF Checker Tool uses the `dig` command-line tool to retrieve the SPF records of a specified domain and validate them 💻. The tool then outputs the result of the validation, indicating whether the SPF record is valid 💚 or invalid 💔, and providing information about any issues found.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/sujayadkesar
```
```
cd SPF-Checker
```
```
sudo chmod 700 spf.sh
```


## Usage 🔧

To use the SPF Checker Tool, simply run the following command, replacing `example.com` with the domain you want to check:
```
./spf.sh example.com
```
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Requirements 📋

The SPF Checker Tool requires the `dig` command-line tool to be installed on your system. This tool is commonly included in most Unix-based operating systems, including Linux and macOS 💻.

## Note ⚠️

Please note that the results of the SPF Checker Tool are only as accurate as the SPF records of the specified domain. The tool does not guarantee the security of the domain or the authenticity of the emails sent from the domain 🔒.
